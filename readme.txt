The dataset used for the detection of model did not fit the requirement of upload in github. Thus I have saved it in [this]() link for access. 
Feel free to try the model out yourself.
It includes a detailed description of all the processes i have carried out in making the model.
It also includes the conclusions I had drawn upon evaluation of the model and what the company needs to improve on its part to curb the problem of Frauds and how to sustain the implemented methods for future.
